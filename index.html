<h2>Overgunned and Overpowered</h2>
<h3>She is Battle Ready</h3>
<p>The ship was designed specifically for battle, featuring innovative pulse-phaser cannons and quantum torpedo armaments, in addition to photon torpedoes, standard phasers and a high-capacity deflector shield system. Another asset is its ablative armour, enabling the ship to sustain multiple hits from enemy weapons, even with the shields inoperable, with minimal damage.</p>
<h2>Borg Threat</h2>
<p>Resist this. The Defiant development began around 2366 in response to the Borg threat to the Federation. We call her an " escort vessel" officially, but the Defiant is nothing less than Starfleet's first design of warship, designed to combat the Borg. They will be shaking in their little Borg booties. The vessel features minimal equipment for scientific research and was not designed to accommodate families<p>

<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Designed to be fast and highly maneuverable with powerful weaponry the Defiant will serve for years to come. Should an interstellar state and military superpower from the Gamma Quadrant happened to start a war with the federation she wounldn't go down without a fight.</p>
